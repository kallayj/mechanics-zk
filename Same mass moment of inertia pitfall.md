When a ring and a solid disk have the same _density_, the solid disk has the greater moment of inertia.

When a ring and a solid disk have the same _mass_, the ring has the greater moment of inertia.

The first scenario is more familiar and intuitive, because the disk and the ring can be made of the same material. The second scenario is contrived, requiring a much less dense material for the solid disk.
