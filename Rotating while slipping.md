The key condition for rotating without slipping is for the center of mass of the object to be moving at the same linear speed as the tangential velocity of the points on the perimeter from the frame of reference of the center of mass, i.e. $v=r\omega$. There are two ways to rotate with slipping, with $v_{\text{cm}} > r\omega$ for an [[initially sliding rollable object]], and $v_{\text{cm}} < r\omega$ for an [[initially spinning rollable object]].
