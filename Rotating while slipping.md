The key condition for rotating without slipping is for the center of mass of the object to be moving at the same linear speed as the tangential velocity of a point on the perimeter from the frame of reference of the center of mass, $v=r\omega$. There are two ways to rotate with slipping, with $v_{cm} > r\omega$ for an [[initially sliding rollable object]], and $v_{cm} < r\omega$ for an [[initially spinning rollable object]].
