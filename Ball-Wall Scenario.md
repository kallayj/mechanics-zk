A ball of mass $m_0$ travels at speed $v_0$ straight into a wall and bounces off at speed $av_0$, where $0 << a << 1$. Find the average force exerted on the ball by the wall for the time interval $\Delta t$ during which it is interacting with the wall.

Solve by using the [[Impulse-Momentum Theorem]], making sure to avoid the [[Collision rebound pitfall]].
