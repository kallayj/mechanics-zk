A ball of mass $m_0$ travels at speed $v_0$ straight into a wall and bounces off at speed $av_0$, where $0 << a << 1$. Find the average force exerted on the ball by the wall for the time interval $\Delta t$ during which it is interacting with the wall.



Limit cases:

The extreme case of $a=0$ has the ball sticking to the wall in a [[Perfectly inelastic collision]] but introduces a problem of violating conservation of momentum for the combined ball-wall system.
